# Fireproof Cloud

This gateway intended for use with Fireproof Cloud.

## Usage

You can call the `connect` function with a database and it will provision a remote UUID for the database, and sync the database to the remote. It will also log a URL to the console that you can open in a browser to connect to the database, as well as try to open the URL in a new tab. Tell us what you think about this workflow!

```typescript
import { fireproof } from "@fireproof/core";
import { connect } from "@fireproof/cloud";

const database = await fireproof('my-db-name');
const connection = await connect(database);
```

### With React Hooks

In a React component, you can use the `useFireproof` hook to get the database and then call `connect` (it is safe to call `connect` multiple times, but in this example we're using a state variable to store the dashboard URL).

```typescript
import { useFireproof } from "use-fireproof";
import { connect } from "@fireproof/cloud";

const { database } = useFireproof('my-db-name');
const [dashboardUrl, setDashboardUrl] = useState<string | undefined>();

// there is a useConnection hook coming soon
useEffect(() => {
  connect(database).then((connection) => {
    setDashboardUrl(connection.dashboardUrl?.toString());
  });
}, [database]);
```

## The Second Argument

The second argument to `connect` is the remote database name. This will be assigned for you if you don't provide one, and the created name will be persisted locally. 

The most common way to use this is if you want to sync to a remote database. The UUID will have been assigned when on first sync, and now you want to connect a new client to that remote.

```typescript
const connection = await connect(database, "my-remote-uuid");
```

If you provide a name, it will be used as the remote database name. If you want to control the name, you should use a prefix unique to your app, so no one else uses your endpoint. This is useful if you want the database name to come from your URL slug, like `/my-app/my-db-name`.

```typescript
const connection = await connect(database, `com.my-app.v1.${database.name}`);
```

Note: if your database already has data in it, connecting to a new remote will do nothing. To prevent data lost, you need to rename the local database to an unused name and the connect.

## No Warranty, For Evaluation Purposes

This preview of Fireproof Cloud doesn't even have login, so don't expect your data to be persisted, etc. Please give us feedback on the workflow! We'll be adding login and access control soon.
